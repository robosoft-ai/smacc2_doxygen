Contributions via pull requests are much appreciated. Before sending us a pull request, please ensure that\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Limited scope. Your PR should do one thing or one set of things. Avoid adding “random fixes” to PRs. Put those on separate PRs.
\item Give your PR a descriptive title. Add a short summary, if required.
\item Make sure the pipeline is green.
\item Don’t be afraid to request reviews from maintainers.
\item New code = new tests. If you are adding new functionality, always make sure to add some tests exercising the code and serving as live documentation of your original intention.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
